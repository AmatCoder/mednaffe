= BUILDING =

To build mednaffe you needs the gtk2 (or gtk3) development libraries.

Run the ``configure'' script here, e.g.:
	./configure 

If you want to build gtk3 version:
	./configure --enable-gtk3

Then build with:
	make

To install them then do:
	make install

(Note: You do not need install mednaffe, you can execute it from /src folder)
